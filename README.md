# SatoshiNakamoto_FrontEnd (The Interface)

Before cloning the repository to your machine, consider checking out the already deployed user interface at [munaizahmed.com](https://www.munaizahmed.com/).

The interface was developed using Vercel's [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) (React v.18) framework and deployed using [Vercel Platform](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment). Vercel allowed me spin up the UI quickly and pair it up with a serverless function. More on the backend [here](https://github.com/Munaiz123/SatoshiNakamoto_Backend). 

### Getting Started Locally

If you prefer run the UI locally or want to deep dive into the code, feel free to clone the repo and run command below from inside the project folder:
```bash 
npm install
```
Start the dev server by via:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
You'll find the root/entry point for the UI at `app/src/layout.js`.
